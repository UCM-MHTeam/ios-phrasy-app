## Overview
### Description
Mental health and mental illness can be tough to deal with especially when communicating our emotions or gauging how a friend is feeling behind that "I'm okay" or "I'm tired" reply. Phrasy helps facilitate the user to phrase their thoughts into words when they cannot find the words on their own. 

This app concept also allows the user to add their friends and see at a high level (like past few days, some sort of stats, etc) if they're doing great, if they need support, or if they require some space at a given time; similar to a status.
